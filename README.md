# DRGRandomizer

Testing out a console app for deep Rock Galactic.

A basic project I made a year ago. Launch the DRGRandomizer.sln file with Visual Studio to get it to work. 

In the future, I might go a bit further and make it into a full-fledged GUI app, but don't count on it.

Not revised for the most recent balance update.
